# Commonly Asked Data Structure Interview Question

## 1. Maximizing the Sum of Even and Odd Digits in a Number

### Problem Statement:

Your task is to help Bob and Jake by writing a program that takes a number as input, then calculates the sum of the even digits and the sum of the odd digits. After calculating both sums, you should print out the maximum of the two sums.

For example, if the input number is `234578`, the sum of the even digits (2, 4, 8) is `14`, and the sum of the odd digits (3, 5, 7) is `15`. Since `15` is greater than `14`, the program should output `15`.

Can you help Bob and Jake find the correct maximum sum?
